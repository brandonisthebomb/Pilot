My mother said I must always be intolerant of ignorance but understanding of illiteracy. That some people, unable to go to school, were more educated and more intelligent than college professors.Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity.Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.There is more to life than increasing its speed.Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.Nothing will work unless you do.
